## Today's Topics: Directing my Focus

### A Conversation with my Inner Completionist
He's in there _somewhere_. My [completionist](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/completionist) drive awaits a list of useful software for it to curate, repair, and employ. Right now, this list is all dried up; on my current trajectory, it doesn't seem like that will change any time soon...

Up until this article, this blog has been exclusive to my adventures with [C3 language](https://c3-lang..org/) changes (i.e., standard-library additions), and there is nothing wrong with that. However, I get the sense that my focus is not broad enough -- to quote a particularly favored idiom, I am "*putting all my eggs in one basket*" when it comes to projects and learning.

I have acquired *myriad* useful skills and concepts while working with C3, which I will continue to do. But in so doing, I have abandoned my post with other projects. Pretty much all of the ones on the front page of this blog are slowly souring and fermenting.

Why do I do this? What is this war in my head that whimsically enraptures my attention with such a high demand? **I don't know**, but I know I need to control it.

I want to keep this short. Here's a general plan I have devised to dedicate myself to a particular subject or project for a minimum of `one hour per day`. This time is _outside_ of any C3 or C3-related projects (e.g. *hookshot*). The intent is to see how this structured approach works for me over the <u>next few months</u>.

> By the way, this blog will be pretty quiet in September, as I will be on a 20ish-day hiatus on the other side of Earth.

> That's why this needs to be a longer effort than just a month or so.

| Project |  Time | Goal |
| ------- | ----- | ---- |
| MFTAH | 2 weeks | Finish payload crypto, well-tested, ready for *nostdlib* |
| CSPAuthD | 2 weeks | Rust rewrite, flexible crypto |
| FlexIC | 3 weeks | Working prototype from a simulated CANbus |
| nanofuxx | 3 weeks | Revive the project, reevaluate direction, start |

### In Closing...
I'm really at a point where I want to see some software of mine enter a maintenance phase. Thanks to my "varied interests" and lack of long-term focus, this can be a challenge. So this short, codeless article will act as ==my pledge== that I will begin to lean towards completed, dedicated projects, green checkmarks, and long-term development cycles.

Hope this wasn't too personal. If you're reading this, thank you.

Until Monday... o7  & [73](https://hamradioprep.com/what-does-73-mean/)
