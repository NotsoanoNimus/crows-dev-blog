### String Trimming: Search vs. ASCII Bitmaps
About a week ago, I submitted [this Pull Request](https://github.com/c3lang/c3c/pull/2407) which simply added the [vertical tab](https://symbl.cc/en/000B/) `\v` and the [form feed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_break#Form_feed) `\f` ASCII escape characters into the default set of the `String.trim` methods, within the core `string` module.

What's funny about this PR is that a 6-character change became an _entire_ benchmarking conversation and exploration of different optimizations for `trim`. Honestly, I love that, it's the kind of optimization we \[_systems developers_\] should live for. I'll get to that in a second.

I started by defending the need for these two characters to be added; since, although they are not as common nowadays, it is the "expected" behavior of a C/C++ analog to include these if those already do (see: [C++'s `std::isspace`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/byte/isspace.html) and [C's `isspace`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/string/byte/isspace)). To which the C3 language designer, Christoffer Lern√∂, correctly pointed out that this will increase the time it takes for the input string to be searched. Ah, an **important detail** indeed.

Shortly thereafter, he also introduced the [`AsciiCharset` construct](https://github.com/NotsoanoNimus/c3c/blob/e4e499edd24862cc6e46bc09e0063625d3bb4438/lib/std/core/ascii.c3#L115) into the core standard library. This structure is simply a `typedef` to a `uint128` integer, and essentially acts as a bitmap for all 127 [7-bit ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#Table_of_codes) characters. I thought this was _very_ clever as a branch-less solution to the speed problem.

```swift
typedef AsciiCharset = uint128;
macro AsciiCharset @create_set(String $string) @const //compile-time
{
  AsciiCharset $set;
  $foreach $c : $string: $set |= 1ULL << $c; $endforeach
  return $set;
}
fn AsciiCharset create_set(String string) // runtime
{
  AsciiCharset set;
  foreach (c : string) set |= (AsciiCharset)1ULL << c;
  return set;
}
macro bool AsciiCharset.contains(set, char c) // no branching!
  => !!(c < 128) & !!(set & (AsciiCharset)(1ULL << c));
const AsciiCharset WHITESPACE_SET = @create_set("\t\n\v\f\r ");
const AsciiCharset NUMBER_SET = @create_set("0123456789");
```

So cool: this is the first time I've encountered a bitmap used for this specific purpose. To visualize this more clearly, an  example helps. Imagine you have the search set `\x20\t\n\r\f\v` (`[space]` is `0x20`). To create a 128-bit integer -- or the number underlying the `AsciiCharset` filter -- out of this resolves to:

```swift
uint128 set =
  (1ULL << ' ') | (1ULL << '\t') | (1ULL << '\n')
  (1ULL << '\r') | (1ULL << '\f') | (1ULL << '\v');
// produces 4_294_983_168, or in binary:
//    00000000_00000000_00000000_00000000_
//    00000000_00000000_00000000_00000000_
//    00000000_00000000_00000000_00000001_
//    00000000_00000000_00111110_00000000 
```

Subsequently, to compute whether the given 127-bit character is in the set, you make sure it's less than `128` in value and then confirm whether the bit in the filter is set.

```swift
// is ' ' (value 32) in the 'set' 4_294_983_168?
bool has_space = set.contains(' ')
  = (32 < 128) & (set & (1ULL << 32))
  = (true) & (1)
  = 1; // true
```

This development  occurred in tandem with a realization I had made, and I was actually writing a response comment on the PR conversation thread about it when the change was submitted.

In fact, the current orientation of the char array is not optimal.

Because of this, I'm actually going to rearrange the default `trim` strings to put space up front. I'll back this up with character frequency statistics.
