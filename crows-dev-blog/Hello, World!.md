My name is Zack P. Welcome to [CrOwS.dev](https://crows.dev/): my personal developer log, mental dumping ground, and loose portfolio of sorts.

My plan for this site is to:
- Get these ideas out of my head!
- Categorize and explain my many different rotating projects, and document my experience working on them individually.
- Maintain a regularly-updated developer log for my own custom operating system, [CrOwS](https://github.com/NotsoanoNimus/CrOwS) and its related tooling.

I'm not sure how long I'm going to keep something like this up, but for a few months I've been very interested in getting a _dev blog_ up and running. Having this will be just the thing I need to keep me on track for certain deadlines and side projects.

With the help of some paid tooling, a la Obsidian Publish, I'm finally able to get things off the ground without worrying about constant hassle with my own webserver and content publishing.

I have a few key projects I'm currently working on:
```
- CrOwS: The Cryptography and Ownership System
  - A toy OS for cryptography and systems security enthusiasts
- MFTAH: The CrOwS bootloader
  - Encrypts and signs a CrOwS (and any other bootable payload) system.
  - Obviously, it also launches these payloads at boot-time.
- C3: An Evolution of C
  - This language is incredible; thus I contribute often.
- CSPAuthD: Crude Single Packet Authorization Daemon
- FlexIC: A CAN-based Flexible, Customizable Instrument Cluster display
```
