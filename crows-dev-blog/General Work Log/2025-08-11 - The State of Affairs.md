### CrOwS.dev
As usual lately, I've been balancing between a few different projects. Today I decided it's high time I create and publish this site to have somewhere to organize my thoughts, goals, aspirations, etc.

_Exciting stuff!_

These past few months I've been so completely enamored by the C3 Language -- we'll get to that in a moment -- that I've let my brainchild fall by the wayside. CrOwS is supposed to be the amalgamation of my personal study/knowledge and, like the legendary [TempleOS](https://templeos.org/) for Terry Davis, something I could use to contain it all (not that I'm some brainiac or anything).

I want to create my own operating system that gives me full **control**, **privacy**, and **ownership** over my own system. I also want this to be a usable system out of the box; not something my wife or my dad could intuitively use, but also not something completely lacking utility either.

This kind of thing is something that is not lacking in today's market (see, e.g., [OpenBSD](https://openbsd.org/)). ***BUT***, it will be mine; my own little baby ecosystem and playground to share with whoever is interested. Plenty of people undertake these challenges and succeed gloriously!

Enter this site. I want its primary purpose to be documentation of the creation of CrOwS, whatever it becomes in the end. Sort of like a long-running changelog where all tribulations, successes, and everything in between are on full display.

### C3
Ah yes, another programming language promising the world to systems developers.

Except this time, it's ==for real==.

[C3](https://c3-lang.org/) is an amazing evolution of the C programming language that attempts to "stay true" to its roots without being overly pretentious about itself. Many other "modern" languages can't say the same, given how foreign and confusing their grammars are as compared to C. On top of this fidelity to our beloved ancestor, C3 fosters a welcoming community that doesn't feel the need to proselytize; they remain, for the most part, self-contained.

In my experience, the communities surrounding [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) are sycophants for their own languages -- not that I don't understand that! -- but to the point that they will run _crusades_ against their competitors. I've seen many fired-up Rust developers completely trash C3's memory management strategies simply because they are different (not worse, nor better).

This, among other reasons, keeps me locked onto contributing to the development of C3. It might be yet another LLVM wrapper, but it is a damn good compromise and it's plenty of fun to write.

I highly encourage you to give it a try!

### Wrapping Up
The format of future "General Work Log" blog posts will probably be something similar to this one.

Some days when I post, it will be a quick check-in and/or recap of some recent work. Other days, it might be an exploration of a general topic that's been on my mind. Also, they're not really expected to be structured, so they might just be abrupt outbursts of goings-on while I have the time to write them.

Hope you enjoy!
